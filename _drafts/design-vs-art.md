It's an age old question.

When I first decided to pursue UX, I very much wanted to ignore visual design. Not because I didn't like it or value it, but because I was convinced I wasn't good at it. Because I didn't really understand it. Because I thought it was subjective, it was art, and that visual designers had an innate talent. That it could not be practiced or learned.
