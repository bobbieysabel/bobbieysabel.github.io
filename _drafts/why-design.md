It's been a little over a year since I graduated college. After several months of being lost and evading the question "so what's next?" I decided to enroll in an online program to study user experience design. Currently I'm looking for my first opportunity in the field. I always get asked: so why design? 

I recently revisited this [essay](https://www.quora.com/q/hmsphvohvdpfszpi/Applied-Discovery-Presentation-from-Build-2013) by David Cole, former Head of Design at Quora. I read it for the first time a few years ago. At the time I was pursuing a degree in nanomaterials engineering, bored out of my mind with the politics in academia, and looking for alternative career paths. I was sort of interested in computer science and just starting to scratch the surface of the design world when a product designer friend sent me the essay.

>And that raises a question for designers: What future are we building, given that we play a role in such an important process?

So I'll admit that this essay and its exploration of building the future that we want to see resonated for somewhat superficial reasons. I grew up watching reruns of Star Trek with my parents and reading about the dystopian high-tech worlds of cyberpunk fiction. Building the future? Sign me up.

But when it comes to major life decisions, I'm slow to decide and slow to act. I wavered. I was afraid of switching out of the major my scholarship was tied to and even more afraid of explaining to my family that I'd wasted two years in school studying something I didn't want to pursue. So I stayed the course. I'd get a job in whatever my major qualified me to do. I'd do what's safe and stable, you know?

My senior year I worked in a lab, helping my team build a device that would collect and image cancer cells. The reason I went into engineering was because I wanted to study biomedical systems and cure cancer. I was helping my mentor synthesize a material that would act as a pump and help push the cells into the device. And I was bored out of my mind the entire year. This is what curing cancer is like? 

Now I know: the work that's worth doing is pretty boring.

But anyway. Why design? What do I like about it? Let me prove to myself that I'm just not jumping on the money train or because tech is glamorous.

##The feedback loop.
It's fast.

##Low barrier to entry.

##Aesthetic.
I love and appreciate art.
