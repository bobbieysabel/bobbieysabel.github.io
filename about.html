                    <h2>The Short Version</h2>
                        <p>I’m Bobbie, a UX designer from New York. I have a background in nanomaterials engineering and computer science. Why the switch to digital design? Well, I love learning about the people who I solve problems for. Plus, when I build with pixels instead of molecules, I can make a greater impact much faster.</p>

                    <h2>The Long Version</h2>
                        <h3>📖 An early love of storytelling </h3>
                            <p>I’ve always loved stories. As an only child, my sole entertainment was my imagination. When I tired of my own stories, I would read the stories of others. I fell in love with myths about the foibles of Greek gods, the cautionary tales of dystopian sci-fi, and the idealist bravery of Filipino revolutionaries.</p>
                            <p>Along the way I discovered computers and the infinite stories that come with them. I was raised by my parents, my grandmother, and the World Wide Web. My family taught me the value of persistence and hard work. The Web taught me to explore and dream. I traversed new worlds on Runescape, set angsty away messages on AIM, and learned how to code for the first time on Tumblr.</p>
                        <h3>🔗 Growing up in a hyperconnected world</h3>
                            <p>In my teens I had my first taste of social media’s power to both build and destroy. It had reconnected parts of my family that had scattered all over the world. But my peers and I struggled with hyperconnectivity and  the anxiety to live picture-perfect, Instagrammable lives. Those experiences marked the beginnings of my interest in how technology could influence our stories.</p>
                        <h3>🎓 The first time I had to decide what to do with the rest of my life</h3>
                            <p>As I approached college, the pressure mounted to pick an area of study. Unfortunately I was dissuaded from pursuing any of the things I actually wanted to do.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>👩🏽‍💻 I wanted to work with computers and help shape the digital landscape where I spent my formative years. </p>
                                    <p>"But what job does that?"</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>✍🏽 I wanted to write the next Great American Novel.</p>
                                    <p>"But you can do it on the side."</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>🐠 My wildest dream was to run to the Philippines where my family was born, and snorkel for the rest of my days. </p>
                                    <p>"🤣"</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        <h3>⚛️ An education in nanotechnology</h3>
                            <p>Out of doctor, lawyer, and engineer, I chose the only one I thought I could stand. In college I studied nanomaterials engineering - the study of tiny things and how we can use their behaviors to solve problems. I conducted research on cancer diagnostic devices and learned some cool stuff that would come in handy as a designer - how to think about a system, how to challenge assumptions, how to experiment. Most importantly, I learned how to fail, get up, and try again.</p>
                        <h3>📐 Discovering design as a practice</h3>
                            <p>I had difficulty remembering the controls for many of the tools I was trained on in my engineering research — I always thought the problem was me.   Out of frustration, I one day Googled  “Why is scientific software so difficult to use?”. In the search results I discovered the world of usability and user experience design, rekindling my childhood aspirations and giving them a name.</p>
                            <p>The frustrations of my younger self, who thought she was somehow less because she struggled to use poorly designed tools, are not unique to me. Software is ubiquitous and humans struggle to interact with it every day.  But it also has tremendous potential to enable our stories rather than hinder them. I want to design digital products that empower.</p>
                            <p>That's my story. What's yours?</p>
