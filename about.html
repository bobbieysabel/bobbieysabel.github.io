                        computer
                        science. Why the switch to digital design? Well, I love learning about the people who I solve
                        problems
                        for. Plus, when I build with pixels instead of molecules, I can make a greater impact much
                        faster.

                        <h3>üìñ An early love of storytelling </h3>
                        <p>I‚Äôve always loved stories. As an only child, my sole entertainment was my imagination. When I
                            tired
                            of my
                            own stories, I would read the stories of others. I fell in love with myths about the foibles
                            of
                            Greek
                            gods, the cautionary tales of dystopian sci-fi, and the idealist bravery of Filipino
                            revolutionaries.
                        </p>
                        <p>Along the way I discovered computers and the infinite stories that come with them. I was
                            raised
                            by my
                            parents, my grandmother, and the World Wide Web. My family taught me the value of
                            persistence
                            and
                            hard
                            work. The Web taught me to explore and dream. I traversed new worlds on Runescape, set
                            angsty
                            away
                            messages on AIM, and learned how to code for the first time on Tumblr.</p>

                        <p>In my teens I had my first taste of social media‚Äôs power to both build and destroy. It had
                            reconnected
                            parts of my family that had scattered all over the world. But my peers and I struggled with
                            hyperconnectivity and the anxiety to live picture-perfect, Instagrammable lives. Those
                            experiences
                            marked the beginnings of my interest in how technology could influence our stories.</p>

                        <p>Out of doctor, lawyer, and engineer, I chose the only one I thought I could stand. In college
                            I
                            studied
                            nanomaterials engineering - the study of tiny things and how we can use their behaviors to
                            solve
                            problems. I conducted research on cancer diagnostic devices and learned some cool stuff that
                            would
                            come
                            in handy as a designer - how to think about a system, how to challenge assumptions, how to
                            experiment.
                            Most importantly, I learned how to fail, get up, and try again.</p>

                        <h3>üìê Discovering design as a practice</h3>
                        <p>I had difficulty remembering the controls for many of the tools I was trained on in my
                            engineering
                            research ‚Äî I always thought the problem was me. Out of frustration, I one day Googled ‚ÄúWhy
                            is
                            scientific
                            software so difficult to use?‚Äù. In the search results I discovered the world of usability
                            and
                            user
                            experience design, rekindling my childhood aspirations and giving them a name.</p>
                        <p>The frustrations of my younger self, who thought she was somehow less because she struggled
                            to
                            use
                            poorly
                            designed tools, are not unique to me. Software is ubiquitous and humans struggle to interact
                            with it
                            every day. But it also has tremendous potential to enable our stories rather than hinder
                            them. I
                            want to
                            design digital products that empower.</p>
