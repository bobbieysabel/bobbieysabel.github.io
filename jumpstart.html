                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>In the United States, high school students are told to blindly go to college, take out loans,
                        pick majors that they have little concrete knowledge in, and graduate college with a mountain of
                        debt and no idea what to do with their degree. On top of that, not all colleges are created
                        equal. Across the nation, institutions vary widely in the types of resources and connections
                        they can provide. In some institutions the advisement ratio is as poor as 1:1600. How can we
                        bring students the information they need and level the playing field?</p>

                            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                            <p>I conducted a competitive analysis on products from three companies in the employment
                                industry: LinkedIn, CareerBuilder, and Indeed. I learned about what each product does
                                well, and more importantly, what they don’t do well. </p>

                            <p>Each product has job search features and Indeed stands out with the best execution of job
                                search. Indeed also has reviews and profiles of popular companies, which would be useful
                                for job seekers doing research on employers. </p>

                            <p>LinkedIn is unparalleled in its brand recognition and extensive social networking
                                features. However, its social network proves to be a double-edged sword. Spammers abound
                                in LinkedIn messages and users chasing “influencer” status post well-meaning, but
                                low-value content.</p>

                            <p>CareerBuilder does a little bit of everything. It has articles on applying for jobs, a
                                directory with information about different career paths, and even a mobile app that
                                displays job listing locations in augmented reality. However, it’s a bloated product
                                that suffers from a confusing user experience. </p>

                        <p>I surveyed 46 people on their frustrations with their career development and gained some
                            valuable insight into the problem I’m interested in. I discovered that a substantial
                            minority of participants who were students were not confident in their chances of finding a
                            job upon graduation. Half of participants who were college grads also reported not being
                            confident in their job prospects when they were students.</p>

                                    interested in getting into tech. It's a lucrative field and I find coding

                                    building, interview tips, etc. Students also wish they had more in-depth information

                                    1. Curation. There is a glut of career information out there. A significant amount
                                    of user survey participants reported finding it difficult to access answers to their
                                    career-related questions. How’s a busy person to know what content is worth their
                                    time and attention?
                                    2. Entry-level is underserved. Not all job seekers have the same needs, but each of
                                    the products I analyzed is built like they do. How can we provide early-career users
                                    with a better experience?

                            <p>I used a card-based design because it chunks content for quick scannability and allows

                                image-based content to be the user’s main focus. It also mapped well with how users
                                thought
                                about
                                organizing their physical clothing. Each piece of clothing had its own place in a

                        <p>Half of the users I tested the Wardrobe prototype with were successful in moving an item with

                            previous flow, so I kept it in the next iteration. However, the other half had expected to
                            be
                            able
                            to move an item after tapping “Edit”, a finding that surprised me.</p>

                        <p>In the initial wireframes, the Details Editor had no obvious options for moving an item to a
                            different category. Users would have had to save the item, then select a category once
                            prompted.
                            Because this wasn’t clear, no users were able to move an item using this method.</p>

                        <p>I determined multiple words that should come to mind when one thinks of their wardrobe, and
                            used
                            these words for the basis of the Wardrobe brand. Wardrobe brand targets a younger audience,
                            but
                            should appeal to all those ambitious dreamers looking to achieve their goals and look
                            stylish
                            while
                            doing it. Wardrobe seeks to impart the mindset that style is about more than “just clothes”;
                            it's
                            about self-expression and confidence. </p>

                            the
                            mentioned adjectives when thinking of the Wardrobe brand.</p>

                            <p>With the brand identity established, I began to create high fidelity mockups. The
                                majority of
                                Wardrobe’s UI is white and grey in order to allow the uploaded content to be the main
                                focus.
                                Gold
                                and blue are used sparingly throughout the app, in accordance with Wardrobe’s brand
                                guidelines.
                            </p>
                            <p>I created inviting empty states to encourage guests and new users to try out Wardrobe’s
                                features.
                            </p>

                                recommendation from Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines. The large nav bar text and the

                                bar icons help users differentiate between the different areas of content. I also placed

                                emphasis on the “Add” button so that the ability to add content is clear from anywhere

                <!--Conclusion-->

                <section class="single-column">
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <h3>What I learned</h3>
                    <p>Document everything. During this project I kept track of all ideas, decisions, and deliverables
                        in a Design Journal document in Dropbox Paper. I have a tendency to revisit and question crucial
                        decisions. Documenting my rationale helped refresh my memory about certain design decisions and
                        resist the urge to toss everything and start from scratch.</p>

                    <p>Conversational design. My solution for this project allowed me to learn more about what
                        scenarios chat is appropriate for and what goes into designing natural and thoughtful
                        conversations.</p>

                    <p>Don’t be afraid to experiment and make mistakes. Sometimes I shy away from experimenting when it
                        comes to visual design because I see it as a more artistic sphere - a muddy unknown that makes
                        me uncomfortable. However, as I received feedback and revised this product’s design, I’ve
                        reinforced two things: 1) there are best practices and guidelines to follow in visual design,
                        and 2) making layouts and using colors that don’t work, and learning why they don’t work, is how
                        I become a better designer.</p>

                    <p>Generate a solution based on evidence, not intuition. It can be difficult to break out of the
                        user mindset. I’ve tried to solve this by thinking of UX design as the scientific method (I have
                        a science-based background). Have a hypothesis, test it out, and make adjustments based on
                        evidence instead of relying on what I would want to see or how I think I would use the product.
                    </p>

                    <p>If I had more time to develop Wardrobe further, I would like to test the prototype on mobile
                        so
                        that
                        the test environment would be closer to the end user’s environment. Wardrobe is a mobile
                        app,
                        but
                        because of technology restraints I had to watch users test it on a laptop screen. I’d also
                        like
                        to
                        explore a calendar feature where users can create outfits and plan when they’ll be worn.
                        Finally
                        I’d
                        like to explore the information design of clothing usage statistics such as cost per wear
                        and
                        most
                        worn items.</p>

                    <h3>Going deeper</h3>
                    <p>I’d like to explore other use cases for the chatbot. Perhaps the chatbot could encourage users to
                        explore their options for career counseling in the physical world, by allowing them to schedule
                        calls with real life career counselors.</p>
