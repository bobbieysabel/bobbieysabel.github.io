                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>In the United States, high school students are told to blindly go to college, take out loans,
                        pick majors that they have little concrete knowledge in, and graduate college with a mountain of
                        debt and no idea what to do with their degree. On top of that, not all colleges are created
                        equal. Across the nation, institutions vary widely in the types of resources and connections
                        they can provide. In some institutions the advisement ratio is as poor as 1:1600. How can we
                        bring students the information they need and level the playing field?</p>

                            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                            <p>I conducted a competitive analysis on products from three companies in the employment
                                industry: LinkedIn, CareerBuilder, and Indeed. I learned about what each product does
                                well, and more importantly, what they don’t do well. </p>

                            <p>Each product has job search features and Indeed stands out with the best execution of job
                                search. Indeed also has reviews and profiles of popular companies, which would be useful
                                for job seekers doing research on employers. </p>

                            <p>LinkedIn is unparalleled in its brand recognition and extensive social networking
                                features. However, its social network proves to be a double-edged sword. Spammers abound
                                in LinkedIn messages and users chasing “influencer” status post well-meaning, but
                                low-value content.</p>

                            <p>CareerBuilder does a little bit of everything. It has articles on applying for jobs, a
                                directory with information about different career paths, and even a mobile app that
                                displays job listing locations in augmented reality. However, it’s a bloated product
                                that suffers from a confusing user experience. </p>

                        <p>I surveyed 46 people on their frustrations with their career development and gained some
                            valuable insight into the problem I’m interested in. I discovered that a substantial
                            minority of participants who were students were not confident in their chances of finding a
                            job upon graduation. Half of participants who were college grads also reported not being
                            confident in their job prospects when they were students.</p>

                                    interested in getting into tech. It's a lucrative field and I find coding

                                    building, interview tips, etc. Students also wish they had more in-depth information

                                    1. Curation. There is a glut of career information out there. A significant amount
                                    of user survey participants reported finding it difficult to access answers to their
                                    career-related questions. How’s a busy person to know what content is worth their
                                    time and attention?
                                    2. Entry-level is underserved. Not all job seekers have the same needs, but each of
                                    the products I analyzed is built like they do. How can we provide early-career users
                                    with a better experience?

                                regularly referred back to Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines to make sure I was

                            <p>I used a card-based design because it chunks content for quick scannability and allows
                                the
                                image-based content to be the user’s main focus. It also mapped well with how users
                                thought
                                about
                                organizing their physical clothing. Each piece of clothing had its own place in a

                                drawer or

                        <p>After completing the low fidelity wireframes, I built a Figma prototype and conducted a
                            usability
                            test with three users. All were aged 18-35 and estimated their phone usage per week to be

                            hours

                            the homepage. They were uncertain about the site navigation and where they were in
                            the app. To remedy this, I built a typical landing page to introduce users to the
                            application, with a CTA that
                            immediately leads them to try the chatbot.</p>

            <h3>Mindmap</h3>
            <p>I determined multiple words that should come to mind when one thinks of their wardrobe, and
                used
                these words for the basis of the Wardrobe brand. Wardrobe brand targets a younger audience,
                but
                should appeal to all those ambitious dreamers looking to achieve their goals and look
                stylish
                while
                doing it. Wardrobe seeks to impart the mindset that style is about more than “just clothes”;
                it's
                about self-expression and confidence. </p>

                    than
                    hangers do.</p>

                    and blue are used sparingly throughout the app, in accordance with Wardrobe’s brand

    <!--Conclusion-->

    <section class="single-column">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>Document everything. During this project I kept track of all ideas, decisions, and deliverables
            in a Design Journal document in Dropbox Paper. I have a tendency to revisit and question crucial
            decisions. Documenting my rationale helped refresh my memory about certain design decisions and
            resist the urge to toss everything and start from scratch.</p>

        <p>Conversational design. My solution for this project allowed me to learn more about what
            scenarios chat is appropriate for and what goes into designing natural and thoughtful
            conversations.</p>

        <p>Don’t be afraid to experiment and make mistakes. Sometimes I shy away from experimenting when it
            comes to visual design because I see it as a more artistic sphere - a muddy unknown that makes
            me uncomfortable. However, as I received feedback and revised this product’s design, I’ve
            reinforced two things: 1) there are best practices and guidelines to follow in visual design,
            and 2) making layouts and using colors that don’t work, and learning why they don’t work, is how
            I become a better designer.</p>

        <p>Generate a solution based on evidence, not intuition. It can be difficult to break out of the
            user mindset. I’ve tried to solve this by thinking of UX design as the scientific method (I have
            a science-based background). Have a hypothesis, test it out, and make adjustments based on
            evidence instead of relying on what I would want to see or how I think I would use the product.
        </p>

        <p>If I had more time to develop Wardrobe further, I would like to test the prototype on mobile
            so
            that
            the test environment would be closer to the end user’s environment. Wardrobe is a mobile
            app,
            but
            because of technology restraints I had to watch users test it on a laptop screen. I’d also
            like
            to
            explore a calendar feature where users can create outfits and plan when they’ll be worn.
            Finally
            I’d
            like to explore the information design of clothing usage statistics such as cost per wear
            and
            most
            worn items.</p>

        <h3>Going deeper</h3>
        <p>I’d like to explore other use cases for the chatbot. Perhaps the chatbot could encourage users to
            explore their options for career counseling in the physical world, by allowing them to schedule
            calls with real life career counselors.</p>
