                    <p> Across the nation, institutions vary widely in the types of resources and connections they can
                        provide. In some institutions the advisement ratio is as poor as 1:1600. Job seekers struggle to
                        find work in an increasingly competitive job market. How can we bring students and early-career

                                    interested in getting into tech. It's a lucrative field and I find coding
                                    interesting. I'd love to learn how others transitioned into tech
                                    from an unrelated field.

                                    I can't afford to take a pay cut to do an internship in tech because I'm saddled
                                    with student loan debt.</p>

                                    that can be found online, it’s frustrating to find quality, actionable information.
                                    Even high-quality content is produced by a variety of people with diverse

                        <p>From research, I knew that users struggled to find answers to their career-related questions
                            and were overwhelmed by the amount of information online. My rough idea for a solution at
                            this point was to build a career guide website that focuses specifically on practical
                            information that would be helpful to students and early-career professionals. The website
                            would have a chatbot to help curate what is shown to users and connect them with resources
                            to point them in the right direction.

                            few guidelines to help designers assess. First, users already have human to human
                            conversations about their careers. Second, users feel comfortable talking or typing
                            about this topic. Third, for an MVP with a chatbot focused on recommending career
                            development content, it is possible for the interaction to be brief, with minimal
                            back-and-forth dialog.

                                Google Search, but are often overwhelmed by the glut of information in the results. The
                                resources they find are vague or they are unsure if it applies to them. A substantial
                                part of my ideation at this point in the design process was devoted to figuring out how

                        <p>After completing the low fidelity wireframes, I built a Figma prototype and conducted a
                            usability
                            test with three users. All were aged 18-35 and estimated their phone usage per week to be
                            11-26
                            hours
                            or higher. The tests uncovered four problematic patterns in the prototype.</p>

                        <p>Users were confused about the initial conversation with the chatbot being
                            the homepage. They were uncertain about the site navigation and where they were in
                            the app. To remedy this, I built a typical landing page to introduce users to the
                            application, with a CTA that
                            immediately leads them to try the chatbot.</p>

                        <p>Users found it difficult to find their bookmarked resources due to the unclear site
                            navigation. I initially had it under the Home tab, but two users were uncertain about what
                            would be under Home and thought their resources would be under the Profile icon. I’d
                            incorrectly assumed that users would look under Profile to find their settings and to log

                        <p>To solve this, I reorganized the site navigation. After sign up or login, Home would become

                            screen. On the main navigation bar, I changed the Profile icon to a Settings icon to prevent
                            users from looking there for their bookmarked content. Users would instead be able to access
                            their profile information on the Dashboard.</p>

                            <p>With the brand identity established, I began to create high fidelity mockups. The
                                majority of
                                Wardrobe’s UI is white and grey in order to allow the uploaded content to be the main
                                focus.
                                Gold
                                and blue are used sparingly throughout the app, in accordance with Wardrobe’s brand
                                guidelines.
                            </p>
                            <p>I created inviting empty states to encourage guests and new users to try out Wardrobe’s
                                features.

                                recommendation from Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines. The large nav bar text and the
                                bolded
                                tab
                                bar icons help users differentiate between the different areas of content. I also placed
                                extra
                                emphasis on the “Add” button so that the ability to add content is clear from anywhere

                        <p>After finishing the high-fidelity prototype, I ran another round of usability testing to
                            identify
                            any
                            problems with the visual design. The user tests uncovered three major issues.</p>

                        <h3>Resource Bundle card design</h3>
                        <p>Users didn’t grasp the idea of a Resource Bundle and thought it was the same as
                            other resources recommended by the CareerBot. To solve this, I extended the Jumpstart
                            branding and renamed the Resource Bundle to a Jumpstart
                            Bundle. I gave Jumpstart Bundles an unique icon and redesigned it with stacked cards
                            to reinforce the concept of a bundle.</p>

                            to group the icons on a grey background to make it look more like a toolbar. I also
                            moved it under the page’s title so the user would associate it with the Bundle
                            instead of the chat.</p>

                            Guide was a menu of clickable links. My solution was to move the Career Guide menu to the
                            top of the screen to indicate that its the main
                            menu for that page. I gave the menu a grey background to group the links together
                            and distinguish the menu from surrounding whitespace. I bolded the links and used
                            the orange brand color to make it clear that they’re clickable.

                <!--Conclusion-->

                <section class="single-column">
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <h3>What I learned</h3>
                    <p>Document everything. During this project I kept track of all ideas, decisions, and deliverables
                        in a Design Journal document in Dropbox Paper. I have a tendency to revisit and question crucial
                        decisions. Documenting my rationale helped refresh my memory about certain design decisions and
                        resist the urge to toss everything and start from scratch.</p>

                    <p>Conversational design. My solution for this project allowed me to learn more about what
                        scenarios chat is appropriate for and what goes into designing natural and thoughtful
                        conversations.</p>

                    <p>Don’t be afraid to experiment and make mistakes. Sometimes I shy away from experimenting when it
                        comes to visual design because I see it as a more artistic sphere - a muddy unknown that makes
                        me uncomfortable. However, as I received feedback and revised this product’s design, I’ve
                        reinforced two things: 1) there are best practices and guidelines to follow in visual design,
                        and 2) making layouts and using colors that don’t work, and learning why they don’t work, is how
                        I become a better designer.</p>

                    <p>Generate a solution based on evidence, not intuition. It can be difficult to break out of the
                        user mindset. I’ve tried to solve this by thinking of UX design as the scientific method (I have
                        a science-based background). Have a hypothesis, test it out, and make adjustments based on
                        evidence instead of relying on what I would want to see or how I think I would use the product.
                    </p>

                    <p>If I had more time to develop Wardrobe further, I would like to test the prototype on mobile
                        so
                        that
                        the test environment would be closer to the end user’s environment. Wardrobe is a mobile
                        app,
                        but
                        because of technology restraints I had to watch users test it on a laptop screen. I’d also
                        like
                        to
                        explore a calendar feature where users can create outfits and plan when they’ll be worn.
                        Finally
                        I’d
                        like to explore the information design of clothing usage statistics such as cost per wear
                        and
                        most
                        worn items.</p>

                    <h3>Going deeper</h3>
                    <p>I’d like to explore other use cases for the chatbot. Perhaps the chatbot could encourage users to
                        explore their options for career counseling in the physical world, by allowing them to schedule
                        calls with real life career counselors.</p>
