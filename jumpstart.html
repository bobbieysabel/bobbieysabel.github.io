            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p> Across the United States, institutions vary widely in the types of resources and connections
                they can
                provide. In some institutions the advisement ratio is as poor as 1:1600. Job seekers struggle to
                find work in an increasingly competitive job market. How can we bring students and early-career
                professionals the information they need and level the playing field?</p>

                    <p>I conducted a competitive analysis on products from three companies in the employment

                            impression. A lot of times when I search for answers on the Internet, it's hard to

                <h2>Defining a Strategy</h2>

                <p>From research, I knew that users struggled to find answers to their career-related questions
                    and were overwhelmed by the amount of information online. My rough idea for a solution at
                    this point was to build a career guide website that focuses specifically on practical
                    information that would be helpful to students and early-career professionals. The website
                    would have a chatbot to help curate what is shown to users and connect them with resources
                    to point them in the right direction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why would chat work in this scenario? Google’s <a

                        target="_blank" class="hover--mint">guidelines on conversation design</a> gives a
                    few guidelines to help designers assess. First, users already have human to human
                    conversations about their careers. Second, users feel comfortable talking or typing
                    about this topic. Third, for an MVP with a chatbot focused on recommending career
                    development content, it is possible for the interaction to be brief, with minimal
                    back-and-forth dialog.

                    <h3>Conversation Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my research I discovered that users find it difficult to obtain answers to their
                        career development questions. A majority said that their first instinct is to do a
                        Google Search, but are often overwhelmed by the glut of information in the results. The
                        resources they find are vague. Often they are unsure if the recommendations apply to
                        their situation. How could a chatbot curate content and provide users with a better
                        experience in their search?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Jumpstart chatbot would ask a few questions about the user’s demographics,
                        experience, and specific career issue. Then it searches Jumpstart’s career guide for
                        content that is relevant to both the user’s career issue and level of experience. For
                        example, if a user was interested in transitioning to a career in tech from an unrelated
                        field, the chatbot might recommend an article on methods of learning software
                        development while working a full-time job. However, the chatbot would not recommend an
                        article comparing full-time, in-person coding bootcamps.
                    </p>

                    <p>I created diagrams of how the conversation might flow between bot and user, displaying
                        different inputs and decisions the user might make.</p>

                    <p>After defining user goals and getting an idea of what the content might look like, I
                        started sketching ideas for Jumpstart’s screens. In this stage I explored the
                        possibility of allowing users to browse through their chat history, but ultimately
                        decided this specific feature was out of scope. The chatbot’s function is to
                        recommend
                        resources, not provide counsel. If users instead have the ability to bookmark
                        resources
                        for later viewing, browsing chat history is redundant. </p>

                        I then created digital wireframes using Figma. I then created digital wireframes
                        using
                        Figma. The app started to shape into a few core features: the Career Guide, a
                        collection
                        of multimedia career development content, the chatbot, to help users navigate the
                        content, a Resource Bundle, which was a curated group of resources recommended by
                        the
                        chatbot, and the Dashboard, where users can view and organized their bookmarked
                        content.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As I refined these wireframes through
                        multiple iterations, mentors gave me feedback that giving the user too much freedom
                        in
                        chat input would increase cognitive load. Users might be uncertain about how to
                        explain
                        their career issue to the chatbot and end the interaction. Instead, I updated the
                        wireframes to give users more predefined choices.

                <h2>Low Fidelity User Testing</h2>

                <p>After completing the low fidelity wireframes, I built a Figma prototype and conducted a
                    usability
                    test with three users. All were aged 18-35 and estimated their phone usage per week to
                    be
                    11-26
                    hours
                    or higher. The tests uncovered four problematic patterns in the prototype.</p>

                <h3>Chatbot as homepage</h3>

                <p>Users were confused about the initial conversation with the chatbot being
                    the homepage. They were uncertain about the site navigation and where they were in
                    the app. To remedy this, I built a typical landing page to introduce users to the
                    application, with a CTA that
                    immediately leads them to try the chatbot.</p>

                <h3>Unclear site navigation</h3>

                <p>Users found it difficult to find their bookmarked resources due to the unclear site
                    navigation. I initially had it under the Home tab, but two users were uncertain about
                    what
                    would be under Home and thought their resources would be under the Profile icon. I’d
                    incorrectly assumed that users would look under Profile to find their settings and to
                    log
                    out.</p>

                <p>To solve this, I reorganized the site navigation. After sign up or login, Home would
                    become
                    Dashboard, making it clearer that various types of information could be accessed from
                    that
                    screen. On the main navigation bar, I changed the Profile icon to a Settings icon to
                    prevent
                    users from looking there for their bookmarked content. Users would instead be able to
                    access
                    their profile information on the Dashboard.</p>

                <h3>The Brand</h3>
                <p>To build the Jumpstart brand, I started by brainstorming all the words that come to mind.
                    I
                    then boiled it down to three words that make up the core identity. </p>

                <p><b>Bold.</b> Bold ambitions require bold action. Jumpstart will help you prepare to make
                    all
                    those career moves.</p>

                <p><b>Energetic.</b> Starting your career is a huge endeavor. Jumpstart’s here to give you
                    that
                    starting push.</p>

                <p><b>Supportive.</b> It can be tough getting your foot in the door. Jumpstart’s got your
                    back
                    and will be with you every step of the way</p>
            </section>

            <section class="single-column">

                <h3>Logo</h3>
                <p>Jumpstart’s icon is a lightning bolt shaped from two marks. The lightning bolt is
                    symbolic of
                    energy and the idea of jumpstarting one’s career. It’s shaped from two marks to give the
                    impression of building blocks or stairs (with Jumpstart being a good foundation to help
                    one get
                    a start on their career).</p>

                <h3>Typography</h3>
                <p>I selected Montserrat as the brand typeface for major headlines and Lato as the brand
                    typeface for all other text. The chatbot typeface is Lato. It’s a modern, readable
                    sans-serif. The semi-rounded details of the characters also give it a warmth that is
                    effective in a chatbot. It engenders trust with users, reinforcing the chatbot’s
                    supportive
                    personality.</p>

                <p>I selected bold colors (which you can see in the style guide) that best convey
                    Jumpstart’s
                    personality. Orange is symbolic of vitality and friendliness. It evokes energy. Blue is
                    commonly used to inspire trust and a feeling of security. Users should feel comfortable
                    trusting Jumpstart to help with their careers. Fuschia and violet are vibrant and
                    contribute
                    to building visual interest throughout the app.</p>

                    <h3>High Fidelity Mockups</h3>
                    <p>After refining the wireframes and establishing Jumpstart’s brand identity, I moved on
                        to
                        creating high fidelity mockups in Figma.
                    </p>
                    <p>I used SVG illustrations by <a href="https://www.drawkit.io/" target="_blank"
                            class="hover--mint">DrawKit</a> to standardize the look and feel of content
                        throughout the app without being redundant. Most available stock photography related
                        to
                        career development can be a bit dull and repetitive, featuring lots of photos of
                        desks,
                        laptops, and people in suits. These photos didn’t fit the energy that Jumpstart
                        seeks to
                        inspire. The illustrations of people helped to humanize the chatbot, and I was able
                        to
                        customize them with Jumpstart’s brand colors.
                    </p>

                </div>




                <div class="single-column">
                    <p>The chatbot typeface is Lato. It’s a modern, readable sans-serif. The semi-rounded
                        details of the characters also give it a warmth that is effective in a chatbot. It
                        engenders trust with users, reinforcing the chatbot’s supportive personality.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because Lato worked so well for the chat bubbles, I tried to use it exclusively
                        across
                        the application. However, as I iterated through different versions of the design, it
                        became clear that a different typeface with heavier weights and more angular details
                        would be more effective. Using Montserrat in the second design creates stronger
                        visual
                        hierarchy and better evokes boldness in accordance with Jumpstart’s brand
                        guidelines.

                <div class="single-column">
                    <p>As I went through multiple rounds of mockups, I sought feedback from mentors on how
                        to
                        make the design look more “polished”. From their guidance learned that mostly,
                        strong
                        visual design comes down to consistency in small details.</p>

                    <p>I revised the card design to
                        match cards in the Career Guide and made aesthetic changes like removing shadows and
                        tightening title line height. I explored what a video card might look like on the
                        Dashboard. I also changed the label design in the side navigation to keep it
                        consistent
                        with the way labels appear on the content cards. Experimenting with visual changes
                        allowed me to strengthen my visual design skills and give Jumpstart a better look
                        and
                        feel.</p>

                    any
                    problems with the visual design. The user tests uncovered three major issues.</p>

                <h3>Resource Bundle card design</h3>
                <p>Users didn’t grasp the idea of a Resource Bundle and thought it was the same as
                    other resources recommended by the CareerBot. To solve this, I extended the Jumpstart
                    branding and renamed the Resource Bundle to a Jumpstart
                    Bundle. I gave Jumpstart Bundles an unique icon and redesigned it with stacked cards
                    to reinforce the concept of a bundle.</p>

                <h3>Career Guide menu</h3>
                <p>
                    Users didn’t recognize that the menu to browse different categories of the Career
                    Guide was a menu of clickable links. My solution was to move the Career Guide menu to
                    the
                    top of the screen to indicate that its the main
                    menu for that page. I gave the menu a grey background to group the links together
                    and distinguish the menu from surrounding whitespace. I bolded the links and used
                    the orange brand color to make it clear that they’re clickable.

        <!--Conclusion-->

        <section class="single-column">
            <h2>What I learned</h3>
                <h3>Document everything.</h3>
                <p>
                    During this project I kept track of all ideas, decisions, and
                    deliverables
                    in a Design Journal document in Dropbox Paper. I have a tendency to revisit and question
                    crucial
                    decisions. Documenting my rationale helped refresh my memory about certain design
                    decisions
                    and
                    resist the urge to toss everything and start from scratch.
                </p>
                <h3>Conversational design.</h3>
                <p>
                    My solution for this project allowed me to learn more about
                    what
                    scenarios chat is appropriate for and what goes into designing natural and thoughtful
                    conversations.
                </p>
                <h3>Don’t be afraid to experiment and make mistakes.</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I shy away from
                    experimenting
                    when it
                    comes to visual design because I see it as a more artistic sphere - a muddy unknown that
                    makes
                    me uncomfortable. However, as I received feedback and revised this product’s design,
                    I’ve
                    reinforced two things: 1) there are best practices and guidelines to follow in visual
                    design,
                    and 2) making layouts and using colors that don’t work, and learning why they don’t
                    work, is
                    how
                    I become a better designer.
                </p>
                <h3>Generate a solution based on evidence, not intuition.</h3>
                <p>
                    It can be difficult to break
                    out of
                    the
                    user mindset. I’ve tried to solve this by thinking of UX design as the scientific method
                    (I
                    have
                    a science-based background). Have a hypothesis, test it out, and make adjustments based
                    on
                    evidence instead of relying on what I would want to see or how I think I would use the
                    product.
                </p>

        <section class="single-column">
            <h2>Going deeper</h3>
                <p>I’d like to explore other use cases for the chatbot. Perhaps the chatbot could encourage
                    users to
                    explore their options for career counseling in the physical world, by allowing them to
                    schedule
                    calls with real life career counselors.</p>
