                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Last week my boyfriend and I decided to take advantage of the warmer weather and visit a New York
                        City classic, the Metropolitan Museum of Art. For those of you that haven't had the chance to
                        go, the Met is an iconic institution and an absolute must-see if you're ever in town.</p>
                    <p>Forget getting tossed around by the throng in Times Square.</p>
                    <p>Forget paying to go to the top of the Empire State.</p>
                    <p>Go to the Met.</p>
                    <p>I've visited many times and exploring those hallowed halls, basking in the magnificence of the
                        Temple of Dendur, marveling at the ancient katanas of the samurai in Arms & Armor--it never gets
                        old. You could go every day for the rest of your life and still find something new every time.
                        This time I was there to visit a new exhibit, <a
                            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/michelangelo"
                            target="_blank">Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman & Designer</a>.</p>
                    <p>Nicknamed Il Divino (The Divine One), Michelangelo was a High Renaissance era sculptor and is
                        heralded as one of the greatest artists of all time. I've been enamored with his work ever since
                        I studied the Renaissance as a child and have had the good fortune to see his work at St.
                        Peter's Basilica in Rome.</p>
                    <p>At the Met, there was no Pieta, no David, and no frescoes from the Sistine Chapel. Italy did not
                        ship out the master's most well-known works to New York to be whored out for "hype" and the
                        masses. There was no iconic, recognizable Instagram picture to be shot here. Instead you got to
                        study a handful of his lesser-known sculptures and peruse the immense amount of concept
                        sketches, drafts, and journals he created throughout his prodigious career.</p>

                    <p>What the new Michelangelo exhibit at the Met did beautifully was showcase the mind and process of
                        a man whose greatest love was his art. It was an enduring testament to his mastery. And it got
                        me thinking: how does one become a master?</p>
                    <p>The idea of mastery and how to achieve it has been my singular focus as of late. I am an
                        engineering student who has finally, after 3 years of trying, acknowledged that there is no love
                        for engineering within me. I stuck with my degree program for two reasons.</p>
                    <p>First, it was the pragmatic choice. At the time I didn't know what I wanted to do and I knew that
                        engineering would at least give me hard, transferrable skills.</p>
                    <p>Second, I wanted to see if I could cultivate a love for the work if I just kept trying.</p>
                    <p>To no avail. After a long period of denial, I have decided to undertake the daunting task of
                        learning UX/interaction design through self-study and breaking into the design industry upon
                        graduation. The reasoning for that jump is a topic for another day. The point is: as with any
                        shiny new direction, this decision has given me an incredible amount of enthusiasm and the pure,
                        not-yet-jaded desire to truly be great at design.</p>
                    <p>To push its boundaries.</p>
                    <p>To become a master.</p>
                    <p>I'm sure that there are many seasoned designers out there who would scoff, and that's fine. I've
                        had my share of laughs at the naive energy of those less experienced than me. However, I
                        realized that my derision is usually a projection of my envy that they get to experience
                        everything anew.</p>
                    <p>An example: in 2016 I had the incredible opportunity to travel to Rome with my family. The
                        greatest highlight of that trip was seeing the inside of St. Peter's Basilica. After nearly an
                        hour of waiting outside in the sweltering Italian sun, we climbed up the steps to feast our eyes
                        on one of the most magnificent sights the man's artistry has to offer. Words completely fail me
                        when trying to describe the splendor of its interior. I almost cried and I'm not even that
                        religious.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>In Met exhibit, there was a digital recreation of the frescoes Michelangelo painted for the
                        Sistine Chapel. Whereas my boyfriend marveled at the art and whipped out his phone to take a
                        picture, I expressed disdain. I teased him. What emotion could that recreation possibly stir in
                        me when I have seen the original Pieta? But I shouldn't have undermined his awe just because I'd
                        seen more. In truth, I wished I could admire the recreation as much as he did.</p>
                    <div class="img-container">

                    </div>
                    <p>In life we should always work to retain that childlike wonder that comes from inexperience, no
                        matter our level of mastery.</p>
                    <p>We should definitely not be mocking that wonder in others.</p>
                    <p>But how exactly does one attain mastery?</p>
                    <p>I'm no master, but I did notice a few themes while I was exploring Michelangelo's mind. I'll be
                        using this list to guide my study of design and keep me focused on the ultimate goal.</p>

                    <h2 class="single-column">Here's what I learned about the pursuit of mastery:</h2>
                    <section class="single-column">
                        <h3>Be prolific.</h3>
                        <p>Michelangelo didn't just wake up one day and chisel realistic sculptures on his first try.
                            When he moved to Florence he became an apprentice and copied the greats that came before
                            him. He drew what was transferable to his passion for sculpting--focusing on three
                            dimensional form. Throughout his career he even drafted paintings for other artists to hone
                            his craft. The only way to get kind of good at making stuff is to make a lot of stuff.
                            Practice a lot. Practice widely.</p>

                        <div class="img-container">INSERT IMAGE HERE</div>
                    </section>
                    <section class="single-column">
                        <h3>Be obsessed.</h3>
                        <p>Michelangelo did not pay attention to anything or anyone that did not contribute to his ability to create art. Like many Renaissance greats, he remained unmarried. He drew detailed sketches of his sculptures over and over again before ever picking up a chisel. He dissected corpses so he could have a greater understanding of the human forms he was sculpting. You don't necessarily have to become a reclusive jerk to attain mastery. But you will have to make sacrifices. You will have to say no to a lot of fun distractions that pop up along the way and keep your eye on your goal.</p>
                        <div class="img-container">INSERT IMAGE HERE</div>
                    </section>
                    <section class="single-column">
                        <h3>Live in reality.</h3>
                        <p>Michelangelo went where the money was. He lived frugally and invested half his earnings in property. He hustled for commissions and did uninspiring projects until he was so popular that clients begged him for his art. This is a difficult truth for introverts such as myself to swallow, but the work you do does not exist in a vacuum. Creatives cannot just make work and expect people to want it. You have to sell yourself. You have to move to where you can have the greatest impact.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="single-column">
                        <h3>Take on challenges that scare you.</h3>
                        <p>When the church commissioned the Pieta, Michelangelo's assignment was to create "the most beautiful work of marble in Rome, one that no living artist could better." A tall order. But he delivered with a sculpture unparalleled in its realism.</p>
                        <div class="img-container">INSERT IMAGE HERE</div>
                        <p>A jealous rival convinced the Pope to ask Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel because it was a medium the famed sculptor was unfamiliar with. This rival tried to set up Michelangelo to fail. Michelangelo didn't even want to take on the assignment. But instead of declining, for four years Michelangelo painstakingly designed, drew, and painted the scenes of Genesis on the chapel ceiling. Today, those frescoes are among the most influential of Western art. Don't back down from challenges. Use them as an opportunity to grow.</p>
                        <div class="img-container">INSERT IMAGE HERE</div>
                    </section>
                    <section class="single-column">
                        <h3>Cultivate a healthy self-belief.</h3>
                        <p>Michelangelo often joked: "with my mother’s milk I sucked in the hammer and chisels I use for my statues". He knew about his artistic ambitions at a young age and believed it was what he was meant to do. Was he destined to be one of the greatest Renaissance artists? Or did his unwavering self-belief coupled with his raw natural talents lead him to make it happen? Either way, you will not master anything if you don't first believe you are capable of doing so.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="single-column">
                        <h3>Never stop learning.</h3>
                        <p>Even as Michelangelo's life came to an end, he didn't stop creating art. He also did his best work in the field of architecture. At the age of 70 he became the chief architect in rebuilding St. Peter's Basilica. He didn't live to witness its completion, but the final product was faithful to his designs.</p>
                        <p>This seems counterintuitive to say, but mastery is more of a process than an end to attain. There is always more to learn and more skills to stack. There is always a boundary to push.</p>
                        <p>So push it.</p>
                        <p>See you on the other side.</p>
