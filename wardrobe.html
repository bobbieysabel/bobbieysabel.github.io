                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        <p>What to wear is never really taught - it’s just something people pick up (or don’t pick up) along the way. Individuals who didn’t pick it up are then thrown into many different social situations they’re unprepared for and are at a loss as to what to wear.</p>

                        <p>Young professionals, in particular, often find managing their wardrobes challenging. Many are still in the process of discovering their personal style, while navigating the world of professional dress codes for the first time. They struggle to strike the balance between expressing individualism and blending in with their environment. How can Wardrobe help these users?</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                        <p>The Wardrobe app alows users to track their clothes in a virtual closet, create new outfits and track outfits worn, and save style inspiration. It encourages users to be intentional about what they wear, how they organize their clothing, and how they present themselves to the world. Wardrobe doesn’t push any individual styles or trends, but encourages users to experiment and figure out what works for their lifestyle.</p>

                    <h2>Research and Discovery</h2>
                        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                            <p>Because Wardrobe a cloud organization tool that helps users manage their wardrobes, I studied a mix of popular cloud products and style apps. If I were to do this again I would study one more style-specific app.</p>

                            <p>The ideal wardrobe management app has:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Pinterest’s rich visual content</li>
                                    <li>Evernote’s robust notetaking features</li>
                                    <li>Stylebook’s domain-specific features</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>

                            <p>Read my entire competitive analysis <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Competitive-Analysis--Ab0ZpcWcnrX3wFoi4NNbYVnhAQ-d8l6ex7iKHwIsk4CtI80w" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                            <p>I also studied critical reviews of lesser-known wardrobe management apps on the App Store:</p>

                            <blockquote>When I try to create an outfit, it doesn’t let me press the check mark button to finish the outfit. Also, you can’t edit the outfits!</blockquote>

                            <blockquote>Seems like an amazing concept, but please let guys try too</blockquote>

                            <blockquote>Not to mention the fact that they make it so hard to find specific clothing items and when you search for them it just comes up with nothing</blockquote>

                        <h3>User Survey</h3>
                            <p>To learn more about Wardrobe’s potential users and their frustrations with managing clothing, I conducted a survey on Google Forms. There were over 90 responders.</p>

                            <div>
                                <canvas id="donutChart1" width="199" height="200"></canvas>
                                <p>70% of survey participants reported having felt frustrated with their clothing, agreeing with the statement “I often feel like I have plenty of clothes but nothing to wear”.</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <div>
                                <canvas id="donutChart2" width="199" height="200"></canvas>
                                <p>79% keep track of their wardrobes mentally or not at all.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div>
                                <canvas id="donutChart3" width="199" height="200"></canvas>
                                <p>81% said they would be interested in trying a digital product that helps them plan and track their wardrobes.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div>
                                <canvas id="donutChart4" width="199" height="200"></canvas>
                                <p>95% would prefer to access such digital wardrobe content on mobile.</p>
                            </div>

                        <h3>User Personas</h3>
                            <p>I conducted follow-up interviews with several of the survey participants to obtain more qualitative data about Wardrobe’s potential users. Through these discussions, I gained valuable insight that allowed me to develop  three user personas for reference throughout the design process.
